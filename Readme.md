## Packaging

_This section is mostly for myself, to have all packaging scripts in one place._ <br><br>
You might need to install the tools web-ext and ManifoldJS before:

```bash
npm install --global web-ext
npm install -g manifoldjs
```

```bash
cd ..
manifoldjs -l debug -p edgeextension -f edgeextension -m easy-link-opener/manifest.json
# Update the appxmanifest.xml and store assets with your/your extension's information before continuing.
manifoldjs -l debug -p edgeextension package easy\ link\ opener/edgeextension/manifest
```
